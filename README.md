# Saluki

This template includes a [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) app with a [Sanity Studio](https://www.sanity.io/).

## Includes

- Svelte v5
- Tailwind v3
- SvelteKit v2
- Vercel Adapter & Image Optimization
- [Shadcn-svelte](https://www.shadcn-svelte.com/)

Recommended for use with node `v22.13.1`.

## Getting Started

### Install the template

#### 1. Initialize template with Sanity CLI

Run the command in your Terminal to initialize this template on your local computer.

See the documentation if you are [having issues with the CLI](https://www.sanity.io/help/cli-errors).

```shell
npm create sanity@latest -- --project <SANITY_PROJECT_ID> --dataset production --template zero-studios/Saluki
```

#### 2. Run the application and Sanity Studio

Navigate to the template directory using `cd <your app name>`, and start the development servers by running the following command

```shell
npm run dev
```

#### 3. Open the app and sign in to the Studio

Open the SvelteKit app running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173).

Open the Studio running locally in your browser on [http://localhost:3333](http://localhost:3333). You should now see a screen prompting you to log in to the Studio. Use the same service (Google, GitHub, or email) that you used when you logged in to the CLI.

### Adding content with Sanity

#### 1. Publish your first document

The template comes pre-defined with a schema containing a `Post` document type.

From the Studio, click "+ Create" and select the `Post` document type. Go ahead and create and publish the document.

Your content should now appear in your SvelteKit app ([http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)) as well as in the Studio on the "Presentation" Tab

#### 2. Extending the Sanity schema

The schema for the `Post` document type is defined in the `studio/src/schemaTypes/post.ts` file. You can [add more document types](https://www.sanity.io/docs/schema-types) to the schema to suit your needs.

### Deploying your application and inviting editors

#### 1. Deploy Sanity Studio

Your SvelteKit frontend (`/sveltekit-app`) and Sanity Studio (`/studio`) are still only running on your local computer. It's time to deploy and get it into the hands of other content editors.

Back in your Studio directory (`/studio`), run the following command to deploy your Sanity Studio.

```shell
npx sanity deploy
```

#### 2. Deploy SvelteKit app to Vercel

You have the freedom to deploy your SvelteKit app to your hosting provider of choice. With Vercel and GitHub being a popular choice, we'll cover the basics of that approach.

1. Create a GitHub repository from this project. [Learn more](https://docs.github.com/en/migrations/importing-source-code/using-the-command-line-to-import-source-code/adding-locally-hosted-code-to-github).
2. Create a new Vercel project and connect it to your Github repository.
3. Set the `Root Directory` to your SvelteKit app.
4. Configure your Environment Variables.

#### 3. Invite a collaborator

Now that youâ€™ve deployed your SvelteKit application and Sanity Studio, you can optionally invite a collaborator to your Studio. Open up [Manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage), select your project and click "Invite project members"

They will be able to access the deployed Studio, where you can collaborate together on creating content.
